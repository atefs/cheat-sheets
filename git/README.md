## 🧠 Core Concepts

**Repository** — A Git repository consists of three areas: the working tree (files on disk), the index (staging area for the next commit), and the object store (all snapshots ever recorded).

**Commit** — A commit is a snapshot of the entire project at a point in time, not a diff. Each commit is identified by a SHA-1 hash (e.g., `abc1234`). This makes history immutable and verifiable.

**Branch** — A branch is a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit. `HEAD` is a special pointer that indicates which branch (or commit) is currently checked out.

**Remote** — A named URL pointing to another copy of the repository. `origin` is the conventional name for the primary remote; `upstream` is often used for the original repo when working from a fork.

### Three Trees

```
Working Directory  ──git add──►  Index (Staging)  ──git commit──►  HEAD
     (files on disk)               (next commit)                (last commit)
```

### Fast-Forward vs Merge Commit vs Rebase

```
Before:                After fast-forward:      After --no-ff merge:
main─A─B                main─A─B─C─D             main─A─B───M
         \                                                \ /
feat──C─D               (no merge commit)          feat──C─D
```

**Fast-forward** happens when the target branch has no new commits since the feature branch diverged — Git simply moves the pointer forward. `--no-ff` forces a merge commit even when a fast-forward is possible, preserving the history of the feature branch.

**Rebase** replays your commits on top of a new base commit, rewriting their SHAs. This produces a clean, linear history but should never be done on branches that others have based work on.

> ⚠️ Never rebase shared/public branches. Rebasing rewrites commit SHAs, which causes diverging histories for anyone who has pulled those commits.

## 🔧 Common Commands

### Initial Setup

```bash
git config --global user.name "Alice"
git config --global user.email "alice@example.com"
git config --global core.editor "vim"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --list
```

### Starting a Repository

```bash
# Initialize a new repo in the current directory
git init

# Clone an existing remote repo
git clone https://github.com/company/webserver.git

# Clone into a specific directory name
git clone https://github.com/company/webserver.git my-webserver
```

### Staging Changes

```bash
# Stage a specific file
git add src/auth/login.js

# Stage all changes in the current directory
git add .

# Stage changes interactively — review each hunk
git add -p                    # opens interactive hunk selector
                              # y=stage  n=skip  s=split  e=edit  q=quit
```

> 💡 Use `git add -p` to create focused, atomic commits. Staging hunks rather than entire files helps you avoid accidentally committing debug code or unrelated changes.

### Committing

```bash
# Commit with a message (use Conventional Commits format)
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT token validation"

# Amend the last commit without changing the message
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Amend the last commit with a new message
git commit --amend -m "feat(auth): add JWT token validation and refresh logic"
```

> ⚠️ Only amend commits that have not been pushed to a shared remote. Amending rewrites the commit SHA and will require a force push.

### Branching

```bash
# List all local branches
git branch

# List all branches including remote-tracking
git branch -a

# Create a new branch
git branch feature/login

# Switch to a branch (modern syntax)
git switch feature/login

# Create and switch in one command
git switch -c feature/payment-gateway

# Rename current branch
git branch -m feature/old-name feature/new-name

# Delete a fully merged branch
git branch -d feature/login

# Force delete a branch (even if unmerged) # ⚠️
git branch -D feature/login
```

### Merging

```bash
# Merge a feature branch into current branch
git merge feature/login

# Merge and always create a merge commit (preserves branch history)
git merge --no-ff feature/login

# Squash all commits from branch into a single staged change
git merge --squash feature/login
git commit -m "feat(login): implement login page"
```

### Rebasing

```bash
# Rebase current branch onto main
git rebase main

# Interactive rebase — rewrite last 4 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~4

# Continue after resolving conflicts
git rebase --continue

# Abort a rebase in progress
git rebase --abort
```

### Pushing and Pulling

```bash
# Fetch remote changes without merging
git fetch origin

# Fetch and merge (or rebase, depending on pull.rebase config)
git pull origin main

# Push branch and set upstream tracking
git push -u origin feature/login

# Safe force push — fails if remote has new commits since last fetch # ⚠️
git push origin feature/login --force-with-lease
```

### Undoing Changes

```bash
# Discard unstaged changes to a file
git restore file.txt

# Unstage a file (keep changes in working dir)
git restore --staged file.txt

# Safely undo a commit by creating a new revert commit
git revert HEAD

# Undo last commit, keep changes staged
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit, keep changes unstaged
git reset --mixed HEAD~1

# Undo last commit AND discard all changes # ⚠️
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Stashing

```bash
# Stash all uncommitted changes
git stash

# Stash with a descriptive name
git stash push -m "WIP: login form validation"

# List all stashes
git stash list
# stash@{0}: On main: WIP: login form validation
# stash@{1}: WIP on feature/login: abc1234 fix typo

# Apply the most recent stash and remove it from the list
git stash pop

# Apply a specific stash without removing it
git stash apply stash@{2}

# Delete a specific stash
git stash drop stash@{0}

# Remove all stashes # ⚠️
git stash clear
```

## 🌍 Real-World Examples

### 1. Start a Feature Branch and Open a PR

You want to add a new feature, keep it isolated, push, and open a pull request.

```bash
# 1. Start from an up-to-date main
git switch main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git switch -c feat/user-authentication

# 3. Make changes, commit with conventional format
git add src/auth/
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT token validation"
git commit -m "test(auth): add unit tests for token service"

# 4. Push and open PR
git push -u origin feat/user-authentication
# Then open PR on GitHub
```

### 2. Interactive Rebase to Clean Up Messy Commits

You have 4 WIP commits before merging; squash and reword them.

```bash
# Rebase last 4 commits interactively
git rebase -i HEAD~4

# In the editor, change 'pick' to:
#   r  reword  — keep commit, change message
#   s  squash  — merge into previous commit
#   f  fixup   — squash + discard this commit's message
#   d  drop    — delete commit entirely

# Example editor content:
# pick abc1234 feat(auth): scaffold login page
# s   def5678 wip
# s   ghi9012 fix typo
# r   jkl3456 refactor token handler
```

> 💡 Use `fixup` (`f`) instead of `squash` (`s`) when the commit message is throwaway (e.g., "wip", "fix", "asdf"). It squashes the commit without opening a message editor.

### 3. Resolve a Merge Conflict

You run `git merge feature/login` and hit conflicts.

```bash
# After git merge feature/login produces conflicts:
git status                    # shows "both modified: src/app.js"

# Open src/app.js — conflict markers look like:
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# const port = 3000;
# =======
# const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
# >>>>>>> feature/login

# Edit the file to the correct resolution, then:
git add src/app.js
git commit                    # completes the merge
# or: git mergetool           # opens configured merge tool
```

> 💡 Set a visual merge tool with `git config --global merge.tool vimdiff` (or `vscode`, `meld`, etc.) and run `git mergetool` for a side-by-side diff.

### 4. Recover a Deleted Branch

You ran `git branch -D feature/payment` by accident.

```bash
# Find the SHA of the deleted branch tip
git reflog                    # look for the last commit on that branch
# Output: abc1234 HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from feature/payment to main

# Recreate the branch at that commit
git switch -c feature/payment abc1234
```

> 💡 `git reflog` records every movement of HEAD, including branch switches and resets. It's your safety net for recovering "lost" work — but only for commits that existed locally.

### 5. Cherry-Pick a Commit from Another Branch

You want one specific commit from `hotfix/timezone-fix` on `main` without merging the whole branch.

```bash
# Get the commit SHA from the other branch
git log --oneline hotfix/timezone-fix

# Apply it to current branch
git cherry-pick abc1234

# If conflicts occur:
git cherry-pick --continue    # after resolving conflicts
git cherry-pick --abort       # to cancel and return to previous state
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### ~/.gitconfig (Annotated)

```ini
[user]
  name = Alice
  email = alice@example.com

[core]
  editor = vim                ; Windows: "code --wait" for VS Code, or "notepad"
  autocrlf = input            ; Linux/macOS: input (LF on commit, no conversion on checkout)
                              ; Windows: true (CRLF on checkout, LF on commit)

[pull]
  rebase = true               ; rebase on pull instead of merge

[push]
  autoSetupRemote = true      ; git push works without -u on first push

[alias]
  lg = log --oneline --graph --all --decorate
  st = status -sb
  co = switch

[init]
  defaultBranch = main
```

### .gitignore Patterns

```bash
# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Environment — never commit secrets
.env

# Build output
dist/
*.log

# macOS metadata
.DS_Store

# Negation — track a specific file inside an ignored directory
!dist/.gitkeep

# Apply a global gitignore to every repo on your machine
git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore_global
```

> ✅ Commit a `.gitignore` at the root of every project. Use [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) to generate language/framework-specific templates.

> ❌ Never commit `.env`, credentials, or API keys. If you do accidentally, the secret should be considered compromised and rotated immediately — removing it from history is difficult and doesn't guarantee safety.

### .gitattributes

```
# Normalize line endings across platforms
# text=auto: Git decides; LF in repo, native endings on checkout
* text=auto

# Force LF for files that must not have CRLF (shell scripts, Makefiles, Docker)
*.sh   text eol=lf
*.bash text eol=lf
Makefile text eol=lf
Dockerfile text eol=lf

# Force CRLF for Windows-only files
*.bat  text eol=crlf
*.cmd  text eol=crlf
*.ps1  text eol=crlf

# Mark as binary (no line-ending conversion or diff)
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.pdf binary
```

> 💡 **Windows users:** set `core.autocrlf=true` in `~/.gitconfig` so Git converts CRLF→LF on commit and LF→CRLF on checkout. Combined with `* text=auto` in `.gitattributes`, this ensures Windows developers get CRLF files locally while the repo stores LF only.

## 💡 Pro Tips

> 💡 **Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force`**
> `--force` overwrites whatever is on the remote. `--force-with-lease` fails if someone else pushed since your last fetch — protecting against accidentally overwriting teammates' work.
>
> ```bash
> git push origin feature/login --force-with-lease
> ```

> 💡 **Stage hunks, not files — `git add -p`**
> Instead of staging entire files, review and stage individual changes. This leads to cleaner, more focused commits and helps you catch debug code before it is committed.
>
> ```bash
> git add -p
> ```

> 💡 **Use Conventional Commits for machine-readable history**
> Format: `type(scope): description`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`.
> This enables automated changelogs with tools like `conventional-changelog` and communicates intent clearly to reviewers.

> 💡 **`git bisect` to hunt down regressions**
> Binary search through commits to find which one introduced a bug.
>
> ```bash
> git bisect start
> git bisect bad                      # current commit is broken
> git bisect good v1.2.0             # this version was fine
> # git will checkout commits for you to test
> git bisect good                    # if this commit is fine
> git bisect bad                     # if this commit is broken
> git bisect reset                   # restore HEAD when done
> ```

> 💡 **`git worktree` — multiple branches checked out simultaneously**
> Check out a branch in a separate directory without stashing or switching. Useful for hotfixes while you have work in progress.
>
> ```bash
> git worktree add ../hotfix-branch hotfix/critical-bug
> cd ../hotfix-branch               # work there independently
> git worktree remove ../hotfix-branch
> ```

> 💡 **`git reflog` is your safety net**
> Every movement of HEAD is recorded in the reflog, including resets, rebases, and branch deletions. If you think you have lost commits, `git reflog` almost always has what you need.

> 💡 **Global `.gitignore` keeps OS and editor noise out of every repo**
> Create `~/.gitignore_global` with entries like `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `.idea/`, `*.swp`. Register it with `git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore_global`. This way every project's `.gitignore` stays focused on build artifacts, not your personal tool preferences.

> ❌ **Never rebase shared/public branches**
> Rebasing rewrites commit SHAs. If teammates have based work on those commits, their history diverges and you create a painful merge situation. Only rebase local, unshared branches.

> ⚠️ **`git reset --hard` discards uncommitted changes permanently**
> There is no undo for changes that were never committed. Use `git stash` if you might want them back. After `reset --hard`, changes in the working directory are gone.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| `fatal: not a git repository` | Not inside a git repo | `git init` or `cd` to correct directory |
| Detached HEAD state | Checked out a commit SHA directly | `git switch main` |
| Merge conflicts after pull | Local and remote history diverged | Resolve conflicts, `git add`, `git commit` |
| `push` rejected (non-fast-forward) | Remote has commits you don't have locally | `git pull --rebase origin main` first |
| Accidentally committed to main | Committed instead of feature branch | `git reset --soft HEAD~1`, then switch to feature branch and recommit |
| Lost commits after `reset --hard` | Commits not pushed yet | `git reflog`, find SHA, `git switch -c recovery SHA` |

---

> 💡 **`git switch -` jumps back to your previous branch**
> Works like `cd -` — one keystroke to return to where you were. Pairs well with `git stash` for rapid context switching.

> 💡 **`git log --follow file` tracks history across renames**
> Plain `git log file` stops at the rename. Add `--follow` to trace commits all the way back to when the file had a different name.

> 💡 **`git worktree` lets you check out two branches simultaneously**
> `git worktree add ../hotfix hotfix-123` creates a second working directory on the hotfix branch. Review a PR and keep coding on main at the same time, no stash needed.

> 💡 **`git log --graph --oneline --all` — visualise branch topology in the terminal**
> This gives a compact ASCII branch graph showing all branches and their merge points. Combine with `--decorate` to see branch and tag labels. Add it as a git alias: `git config --global alias.tree 'log --graph --oneline --all --decorate'` so you can run `git tree` anywhere.
